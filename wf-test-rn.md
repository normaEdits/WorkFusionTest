**Version 10.2**

**RELEASE DATE** October 30, 2020

The new Intelligent Automation Cloud v.10.2 provides you with a set of innovations to increase productivity and simplify your routine work. The release includes but is not limited to the following features:

- **WorkSpace 2.0** is a human-in-the-loop tool designed to tackle various issues with the exception-handling process, allowing faster completion and improving compliance. Compared to the previous version, WorkSpace 2.0 is strengthened with a feature that enables you to manipulate and adjust the workflow.** 
- With the new **A/B testing** feature, you can validate automation variations, review Analytics dashboards for test results, and choose the most confident automation version, thus improving performance of the pre-trained bots. 
- **Automated retraining** allows you to start retraining on a collected training set, know the estimated duration, and see Analytics for validating models. The bot retraining workflow becomes even more friendly to business users, now available in the Control Tower UI.** 
- **Centralized user management and role-based access control** are introduced to rule all the ecosystem components, including Analytics dashboards and WorkSpace.** 
- **Analytics** introduces 20 new data points, drill-down capability, improved navigation, and simplified, user-friendly analysis.** 
- **Intelligent Automation Cloud Developer** updates include the new Launcher application for components management and other improvements to your local development environment.** 
- **ML SDK** extensions address complex problems, including but not limited to hybrid models, grouping, and classification cascade training.** 
- **Optimized orchestration** of services allows you to reduce hardware requirements to 11 servers for a high-availability environment.** 
- Additional bug fixes, improvements, and deprecations address user requests and solve earlier flaws. 

For more information on each improvement, see detailed descriptions below.

**A/B-testing of the Use Cases**

The A/B testing functionality enables you to easily test adjustments or new versions of automation and gather key metrics to determine whether to implement these changes in the production environment.

The intuitive workflow makes the whole procedure easy to run, with data available for comparison after actual testing.

With the help of A/B tests, you can:

- safely run data, historical or live, through a new version without impacting the original version. 
- manage variations of business processes to be tested. 
- test updated manual task efficiency and routing. 
- automatically gather data to measure and compare two different versions. 
- analyze business metrics and compare versions.
